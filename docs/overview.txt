=====================
Django External links
=====================

A generic application to keep track of the clicks on the external links
in your sites

Installation
============

1. Get the code
    - Get a tarball
    - Pull from the Github repo:
        http://github.com/jjdelc/django-external-links

2. Add 'external_links' in your PYTHONPATH
    - Add a symlink to your proj dir
    - Put it you your python site-packages
    - Anything else that does it

3. Add 'external_links' to your INSTALLED_APPS

4. Run ./manage.py syncdb
    [proj] ./manage.py syncdb
    Creating table external_links_linkclick
    Installing index for external_links.LinkClick model

5. Add the UrlConf somewhere in your URLs
    urlpatterns += patterns(''
        url(r'^external/', include('external_links.urls')),
    )


Keeping track of links
======================
Every external link on the site should actually be a redirection to
the external link endpoint, which will keep track of the click and 
perform the redirection to the final site

Reference
=========

TemplateTags
~~~~~~~~~~~~

'external' tag
--------------

    This is what you will be using the most, add
        {% load external_link_tags %}
    anywhere in your templates, now for each external link use
    the {% external %} tag:
        <a href="{% external "http://example.com" %}">Other site</a>
    
    Which should translate to:
        <a href="/external/?link=http%3a%2f%2example.com">Other site</a>

externalblock block tag
-----------------------

    On cases where you will have several links in a variable area, say a blog
    post or user generated content, you can wrap that around the 
    {% externalblock %} block

        {% externalblock %}
        {{ entry.text }}
        {% endexternalblock %}

    The entry text has this content
        {% externalblock %}
        My text <a href="http://example.com">my link</a>
        {% endexternalblock %}

    Will finally render:
        My text <a href="/external/?link=http%3a%2f%2example.com">my link</a>


Models
~~~~~~
    The LinkClick model represents a clicked link, it stores:
        The logged user, or None if it's an annonymous session
        The Date and Time
        The referer page from where the click was made
        The destination site
        User's IP address

    To use, call the 'store' method with the view's Request object
    as parameter
        >>> destination = request.GET['link']
        >>> clicked_link = LinkClick(link=destination)
        >>> clicked_link.store(request)

    But you shouldn't need to do that, it's all done in the view


Views
~~~~~
    There's an external_link view that registers all the links
    that go through the external_links redirection.

    If the view is sent with no "link" GET param, it will default
    to '/'

Admin
~~~~~
    The app comes with some Admin fun


Regular clicks record
---------------------
    Add these lines to your admin file, the 'LinkClickAdmin' ModelAdmin has a
    set of preconfigured attributes, filters and hierarchy set that you'll need
    when looking at the clicks made.
    Simply add these lines to your admin file

        from external_links.admin import LinkClickAdmin
        from external_links.models import LinkClick
        admin.register(LinkClick, LinkClickAdmin)

Top clicked links
-----------------
    There is also an included view to display the top 15 clicked links. To
    install it simply add the following urlconf:
    
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),

    Now you can access /admin/external_links/linkclick/top/ and will display 
    the top clicked links. You'll find a link to this on the LinkClick change_list
